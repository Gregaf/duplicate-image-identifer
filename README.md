# Image Feature Extraction with Deep Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the utilization of deep learning techniques for image feature extraction using TensorFlow/Keras. The provided code showcases a simple implementation to extract features from images using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
Motivation

In many computer vision applications, extracting meaningful features from images is a crucial step for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and content-based image retrieval. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown remarkable performance in automatically learning and extracting relevant features from images. This project serves as a learning resource and starting point for developers interested in leveraging deep learning for image feature extraction tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-feature-extraction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd image-feature-extraction
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.10 image_feature_extraction
pyenv activate image_feature_extraction
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your images in the project directory or specify their paths in the code.

2. Run the feature extraction script:

```bash
   python feature_extraction.py
```

3. Check the output for extracted features from the images.
